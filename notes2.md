instead of requiring the player to play a specific hand, they can always play any hand they like. instead, each round, certain hands get multipliers. The player plays 5 hands, then goes to the shop. Rinse and repeat.

hand types:

set: generic set (goal gives multiplier for playing any set of x length), specific set (goal gives multi for player a specific set). For either one, it could be a specific length or any length. full house and other variants. (2 pair, full house, 3 pair, double triplet.etc)

parity set: all numbers are of the same parity, score based on count of numbers \* x. Goal could increase this value, and request a specific size of parity set. could also be prime numbers

run: generic run, specific run, for either, could be generic length or specific length

chance/sum: score based on sum of dice, its the fallback if no other hand is found. Can have goals that ask for a specific sum, or a sum of at least x

specific series: fibonachi, pi, euler. Score based on how many numbers in the series you can submit

Lucky Paw: Gain 1 life each time you submit
