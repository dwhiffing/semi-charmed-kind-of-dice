My current idea is a "dice building" game where you start with 3 d4s. In this game, a 1 on a die is a "black cat", which when rolled, makes you lose a life. You start with 9 lives, and when you lose the game is over. Regular gameplay is similar to yahtzee, except you are presented with a random set of goals to complete. For each set of goals you are presented with, you can select a subset of the dice you have rolled to "submit". You are rewarded with currency based on the number of goals you completed. With your currency, you can shop between rounds to buy more lives, more dice, or to upgrade your dice to the next standard die up (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20). You may also be able to purchase special passive abilities or add enhanced faces to your dice, though I dont have any specific ideas for those abilities yet. Your goal would be to survive as many rounds as possible. Each round, the goals get harder and harder to complete, making it harder to acquire currency and keep your life count up.

Why it works: It's a risk that is always present, on every single die you add to your bag. It's not a random event deck or a special enemy; it's baked into the fundamental action of the game. This forces a fascinating risk/reward calculation every time you decide to roll. Do I roll my full set of seven dice to try and hit that difficult "Large Straight" goal, knowing that I'm dramatically increasing my odds of rolling a '1' and losing a precious life? That's a meaningful choice. Every roll is a "push your luck" moment.

However, let's probe this mechanic a bit. As you upgrade from a d4 to a d20, the chance of rolling a '1' decreases from 25% to 5%. This means upgrading a die is a pure, unadulterated buff: you get access to higher numbers and you reduce your risk.

Design Question: Is this too straightforward? The most compelling choices have downsides. What if we complicate this?

Alternative Idea 1: What if certain powerful abilities or goals require you to submit a '1'? Suddenly, the Black Cat is a cursed resource. You might need to roll one to get a massive currency bonus, but you'll have to pay a life for the privilege. Now, keeping a volatile d4 in your bag becomes a strategic choice, not just a remnant of the early game.

Alternative Idea 2: What if the "Black Cat" effect changes based on the die type? A '1' on a d4 costs 1 life. Maybe a '1' on a d20 is rarer, but it costs you 3 lives, or drains some of your currency. This makes the decision to upgrade a die an interesting trade-off between frequency of risk and severity of risk.

The Gameplay Loop: Goals and Submissions
The Yahtzee-style goal completion is a good framework. It's familiar, so players will grasp it quickly. The key to making this compelling will be the design of the goals and how you submit dice to them.

You said: "...you can select a subset of the dice you have rolled to 'submit'." This is a critical detail that needs to be razor-sharp.

Let's consider two interpretations:

The "One Hand" Model (like Poker/Balatro): You form one set of dice from your roll (e.g., three 5s and two 4s for a Full House) and submit it. This single submission is scored against all available goals it qualifies for. This is clean and creates a puzzle: "What's the best single combination I can make from this roll to satisfy the most valuable goals?"

The "Bucket" Model: You have your roll, and you can assign dice to different goals. For example, use two 6s for a "Pair of 6s" goal, and use a 3, 4, 5 for a "Small Straight" goal.

I strongly advocate for the "One Hand" model. It's more minimalistic and forces harder decisions. If you have a roll of 1,2,3,4,4, you have to choose: do I submit the 1,2,3,4 for the "Small Straight" goal, or do I submit the two 4s for the "Pair" goal? You can't do both. This creates strategic sacrifice, which is always compelling.

Regarding goal design: The difficulty scaling is good, but make sure "harder" doesn't just mean "bigger numbers." Introduce goals that create strategic variety.

Early Game Goals: "Any Pair," "Sum of Dice is greater than 10."

Mid Game Goals: "Full House," "Four dice of the same parity (all odd/even)."

Late Game "Puzzle" Goals: "Create a straight using only prime numbers," "Have the sum of your dice be exactly 33," "Submit exactly two pairs with a sum total of 20."

These latter goals make the player care about their entire collection of dice, not just their upgraded d20s. That low-rolling d4 might suddenly be the most valuable die in your bag to hit a specific low-sum goal.

The Shop: Fleshing out the Synergies
This is where you can really inject the Balatro-style magic. The choices of more dice vs. better dice vs. lives are a great start. Here are some ideas for the special passive abilities and enhanced faces, designed to create interesting builds.

Passive Abilities (Amulets, Charms, etc.):

Lucky Paw: The first Black Cat you roll each round is ignored. (Simple, effective, great for beginners.)

Nine Lives: Once per game, when you would lose your last life, set your life to 1 instead. (Classic extra life mechanic.)

Scavenger: Gain 1 currency for each '1' you roll. (Turns your risk into a resource. This is the kind of design I love.)

Die Hard: For each life you are missing from your starting total of 9, gain +1 to the sum of your submitted dice. (A comeback mechanic that encourages risky play.)

Collector: Gain a permanent +1 currency bonus each round for each unique type of die (d4,d6,d8, etc.) you possess. (Rewards diversifying your dice pool.)

Enhanced Dice Faces (Modifications you buy for one specific die):

Golden Face: You can buy a mod that turns one face of a die (e.g., the '6' on a d6) into a wild card that can act as any number.

Split Face: A face that counts as two numbers at once. For example, a "2/3" face could be used as a 2 or a 3, helping to complete straights.

Clover Face: If this face is part of a submitted set, you gain +3 currency. The downside? It's on the '1' face of the die. So to get the bonus, you have to risk rolling a Black Cat. Delicious.

Reroll Face: If you roll this face, you gain an extra reroll token for the round.

Vampiric Face: When you submit a set containing this face, you heal 1 life. This would be a very expensive, high-value upgrade.

Summary
You have a fantastic, tense core loop here. The Black Cat mechanic is a winner because of its simplicity and the constant pressure it applies.

My main advice is:

Lean into Trade-offs: Avoid "pure good" upgrades. Make every choice have a potential downside or opportunity cost. Complicate the Black Cat mechanic so that a '1' isn't always something to be avoided.

Enforce Hard Choices: Use the "One Hand" submission model to force players to prioritize goals and sacrifice potential rewards.

Design Goals for Variety: Write goals that make players want a diverse collection of dice, not just a bag full of d20s. Make them think like a puzzle-solver.

The skeleton is rock-solid. The gameplay will live or die on the quality and variety of the goals you create and the synergies available in the shop. Keep it clean, keep the choices meaningful, and you could have a real gem on your hands.
